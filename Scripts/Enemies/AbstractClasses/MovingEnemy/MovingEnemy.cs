/*
ISSUE: Currently, there is weird looking behavior related to changing from following a path to simple movement.
This is easy to see when there are lots of enemies on one side of a long wall, with player being on the other 
side of the wall. They calculate their path to be parallel to the wall, and when they start following it, they
start walking about 45 degrees away from the wall, due to repulsion forces. After walking a short distance in this
direction, they switch to simple movement, and because player is on the other side of the wall, they basically
turn 180 degrees and start walking backwards, only to meet a wall, calculate a path parallel to the wall, and Â¨
the cycle repeats.

POSSIBLE SOLUTION: Whenever an enemy would switch from following a path to simple movement, they could first
perform an A* to see the direction of the shortest path, and if the direction of a simple path is too different,
the enemy would start following the new path with a new 1 second path following timer, instead of starting to move
simply.

Currently, this issue isn't bothering me *that* much and I would rather work on other parts of the game, but this
could be revisited and fixed in the future.

/*
This abstract class allows enemies to simply (in a straight line) move towards the player and repulse each other,
so that they don't stack on top of each other. Additionally, if an enemy hits a wall, they will find a path to
the player and start following it for a short while, before switching back to simple movement.
